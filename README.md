# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Revenue Prediction

## Project Description  
Predicts box office revenue of movies using metadata from TMDB and IMDB, including genres, directors, and lead actors.

---

## Results  
The model shows signs of overfitting. While Random Forest performs better than Linear Regression, the available dataset of ~3200 movies may not generalize well across all genres, directors, and lead actors. More data or stronger regularization may improve results.
